# Abstract:

In the age of information and entertainment, users often seek detailed insights about movies before deciding what to watch. This project addresses this need by creating an application that retrieves comprehensive information about movies from the TMDB API and gathers user reviews from IMDb using web scraping. Additionally, sentiment analysis provides an understanding of user sentiments associated with movies.

# Technologies Used:

## TMDB API: 
The TMDB API was employed to collect essential details about movies, including titles, genres, runtime, ratings, posters, and more.

## Sentiment Analysis: 
By employing Natural Language Processing techniques, sentiment analysis was performed on the scraped user reviews to determine whether the sentiments were positive, negative, or neutral.
Methodology:

## Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup:

BeautifulSoup was utilized to extract user reviews from these IMDb URLs.
Sentiment Analysis:
Preprocessing techniques were applied to clean and prepare the user reviews for analysis.
Using a sentiment analysis model, each review was classified as positive, negative, or neutral.

# Application Development:
An interactive application was developed that allowed users to search for movies.
The application displayed movie details fetched from the TMDB API.
User reviews and associated sentiment analysis results were presented alongside the movie details.
Findings:

Comprehensive Movie Details: The application successfully fetched and presented detailed movie information, including title, genre, runtime, rating, and poster.

User Reviews and Sentiment Analysis: The web scraping process retrieved user reviews from IMDb. Sentiment analysis on these reviews revealed the general sentiments associated with the movie.

User Engagement: The application provided a user-friendly interface that facilitated easy searching and retrieval of movie details.
